## Project Description

This project is a full-stack application which aims to help Code Fellows administrators and teaching assistants (TAs) visualize metrics regarding help ticket velocity (how many help tickets each TA is taking everyday, how long is each TA spending on a ticket, which classes have the most number of tickets at any given time, etc.). Through this project, Code Fellows administrators are able to identify how to best allocate TAs to help students as well as identify possible areas of improvement with Code Fellows' course curriculums.
